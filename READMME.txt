Memgrind Test:

Test 1 was a requirement in the write up where we had to allocate a 1 byte object then free
it right after, 120 times. 

Test 2 was a requirement in the write up where we had to allocate 120 1 byte objects and 
store them in an array and when are all stored we would then deallocate them from the start.

Test 3 was a requirement in the write up where we had to use random choice and if it was
0 we would allocate the object and add it to the array. If it was 1 then we would deallocate 
the last item we added in the array. Until we allocate 120 times.

Test 4 was one we created where we allocated all 120 1 byte objects but instead of freeing 
it from the start of the array, we began from the end of the array.

Test 5 was one we created which was similar to test 4, but this time choose the malloc to 
be of size 1 byte or 65 byte. So if it was 0 it would malloc an object of size random and 
if it was 1 it would free the previous object.
